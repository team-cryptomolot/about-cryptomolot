## Staking is your way to earn more crypto tokens in proof-of-stake protocols.

Staking provider is an important choice for a delegator. You should be confident that your provider will have close to 100% uptime to earn as many rewards as possible. The commission should be fair, and the behavior of the provider on the blockchain should reflect your vision since they will often represent your opinion in governance proposals. In Cryptomolot, we believe that every single user matters, which is why we do our best to be your best choice.
